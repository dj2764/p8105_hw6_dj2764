Interpretation of the adjusted odds ratio plot

The plot displays the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals comparing the odds of a homicide being solved for male victims
relative to female victims, after controlling for victim age and race.
The cities are ordered by their estimated ORs from lowest to highest.

Across most cities, the estimated OR is below 1, indicating that
homicides involving male victims are generally less likely to be solved
compared with those involving female victims, holding age and race
constant. This pattern is consistent with national investigative trends
and suggests that cases involving female victims may receive more
investigative attention or may be easier to resolve.

Several cities show OR estimates far below 1 (e.g., New York, NY; Baton
Rouge, LA), with relatively narrow confidence intervals, suggesting a
robust and substantial difference in solve rates by victim sex. In
contrast, a smaller number of cities exhibit ORs close to or slightly
above 1, indicating little or no difference in solve probability between
male and female victims.

The width of the confidence intervals varies substantially across
cities. Cities with larger intervals likely have smaller sample sizes or
less variability in solve rates across sexes, leading to less precise
estimates. A few cities (e.g., Albuquerque, NM; Stockton, CA) display
very wide confidence intervals, sometimes crossing 1, reflecting
instability in the logistic regression estimates and possibly complete
or near-complete separation in the data.

Overall, the plot highlights a consistent trend across U.S. cities: male
homicide victims tend to have lower adjusted odds of having their cases
solved, though the magnitude and certainty of this effect vary
considerably by city.

# Problem 2

## Load and prepare data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("weather_df")

weather_small <- weather_df |> 
  select(tmax, tmin, prcp) |> 
  drop_na()

fit = lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = weather_small)
```

## Run 5000 bootstrap replications

``` r
set.seed(123)

boot_results <- tibble(
  boot_id = 1:5000
) |> 
  mutate(
    sample = map(
      boot_id,
      ~ sample_n(weather_small, size = nrow(weather_small), replace = TRUE)
    ),
    
    model = map(sample, ~ lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = .x)),
    
    r2 = map_dbl(model, ~ glance(.x)$r.squared),
    
    beta_ratio = map_dbl(
      model,
      ~ {
        coefs <- tidy(.x)
        beta1 <- coefs$estimate[coefs$term == "tmin"]
        beta2 <- coefs$estimate[coefs$term == "prcp"]
        beta1 / beta2
      }
    )
  )
```

## Plot R² distribution

``` r
ggplot(boot_results, aes(x = r2)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Bootstrap Distribution of R²",
    x = "R²",
    y = "Frequency"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw6_dj2764_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

The bootstrap distribution of R^2 is approximately symmetric and
bell-shaped, centered around roughly 0.94. The spread of the
distribution is quite narrow, with almost all estimates falling between
0.935 and 0.947. This indicates that the linear model with tmax as the
response and tmin and prcp as predictors explains a stable and
consistent proportion of the variance across bootstrap resamples. The
small amount of variability suggests that the model’s explanatory power
is not highly sensitive to sampling fluctuations in the original
dataset.

## Plot β¹ / β² distribution

``` r
ggplot(boot_results, aes(x = beta_ratio)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Bootstrap Distribution of β¹ / β²",
    x = "β¹ / β² (tmin coefficient / prcp coefficient)",
    y = "Frequency"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw6_dj2764_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

In contrast, the bootstrap distribution of the ratio 𝛽1/𝛽2 (coefficient
of tmin divided by coefficient of prcp) is asymmetric and strongly
right-skewed, with a long tail extending toward very negative values.
The bulk of the estimates fall between roughly −250 and −150 , but the
presence of extreme outliers indicates instability in this ratio. This
behavior is expected because the denominator (prcp coefficient) is often
close to zero; even small changes in this coefficient can cause the
ratio to vary dramatically, amplifying noise and producing highly
variable estimates.

Overall,R^2 exhibits a tight, well-behaved bootstrap distribution,
whereas 𝛽1/𝛽2 shows high sensitivity and instability, reflecting the
difficulty of interpreting a ratio involving a coefficient that is close
to zero.

## Compute 95% confidence intervals

  summarize(
    lower = quantile(r2, 0.025),
    upper = quantile(r2, 0.975)

  summarize(
    lower = quantile(beta_ratio, 0.025),
    upper = quantile(beta_ratio, 0.975)
  )

To model birthweight, I began by considering biologically and clinically
plausible predictors that are known to influence fetal growth.
Birthweight is strongly determined by fetal size at birth, gestational
maturity, maternal physical characteristics, and prenatal behaviors.
Based on this reasoning, I included:

Fetal size indicators: head circumference (bhead) and length (blength)

Gestational maturity: weeks of gestation (gaweeks)

Maternal anthropometrics: pre-pregnancy BMI (ppbmi), pre-pregnancy
weight (ppwt), and pregnancy weight gain (wtgain)

Maternal demographic factors: race (mrace) and age (momage)

Behavioral exposures: smoking during pregnancy (smoken)

Infant sex: (babysex), as male infants tend to weigh more on average

These variables reflect a domain-informed model, rather than a purely
data-driven variable selection procedure. The goal was to include
predictors with well-established relationships to birthweight while
avoiding unnecessary interactions or higher-order terms that would
complicate interpretation.

## Residuals vs fitted plot (using add_predictions / add_residuals)

``` r
bw_aug <- birthweight_df |>
  modelr::add_predictions(bw_mod) |>
  modelr::add_residuals(bw_mod)

ggplot(bw_aug, aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Fitted Values for Birthweight Model",
    x = "Predicted birthweight (grams)",
    y = "Residuals"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw6_dj2764_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

The residuals vs fitted values plot shows that the residuals are
centered around zero across the full range of predicted birthweights,
indicating that the model does not exhibit strong systematic bias. There
is no clear curvature or pattern in the residual cloud, which suggests
that the assumed linear relationship between the predictors and
birthweight is appropriate.

The spread of residuals remains relatively constant for fitted values
between roughly 2500 and 4000 grams, where most observations fall. At
very low fitted birthweights (under ~1500 grams), residual variability
increases and a few extreme outliers appear. This pattern is expected
because extremely small infants are comparatively rare and tend to have
more heterogeneous birth outcomes. These points do not represent a
violation of model assumptions but rather reflect natural variability in
this part of the data.

Overall, the plot does not indicate major issues with nonlinearity or
heteroscedasticity, and the linear regression model appears to provide a
reasonable fit for the majority of observations.

## Model A: length at birth + gestational age (main effects only)

bw_mod_A <- lm(
  bwt ~ blength + gaweeks,
